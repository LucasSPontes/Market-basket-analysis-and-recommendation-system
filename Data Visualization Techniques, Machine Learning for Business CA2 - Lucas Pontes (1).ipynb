The presence of items that can be easily identified as commonly bought together, like ham and pickled vegetables and whole milk and buns, reinforce the results obtained from the analysis, but besides that, some found associations aren't so obvious and can be really useful for companies' sales strategy.\n",
    "        Indian cuisine is loaded with different recipes mostly unknown by older adults in western societies, which can benefit from a recommendation system that indicates a different cuisine based on one that the user already likes. For that, a dashboard that allows the user to search for data related to a known recipe can be very useful, as well as a dashboard that allows the user to discover new recipes based on dietary preferences, flavour, and more. An interactive scatter plot with an easy interface can also be helpful for older adults to identify and take into consideration preparation and cooking time, saving precious time.\n",
    "        The predictive model was created by applying the prominent KNN algorithm using cosine distance as a method, setting the analysis as a recommendation system. To test the model a random cuisine was picked, and the main recommendation share several characteristics with the one applied in the analysis, being both vegetarian and having similar flavours, which contributes to the probability of someone that like one, also like the other one. The model can be used by anyone interested in Indian cuisine and can be lucrative to companies that have those people as their target audiences."
